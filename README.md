## About

This package contains a simple email template that you may use with any framework or library.
All you have to do is install the email-template package, and you instantly have access to all email templates, saving you from having to complete all the work and install all dependencies the old-fashioned way.

## Installation

```
npm install email-template
```

```sh
yarn add email-template
```

## Usage

First of all, you need to import the email template function from the package.

```js
const { emailTemplate } = require("email-template");
```

Then, you can use the emailTemplate function to generate the email template you want.

```js
const email = sendMail(email, fullName, authEmail, authPassword)
```
This function takes 4 parameters:
- email: the email of the user you want to send the email to.
- fullName: the full name of the user you want to send the email to.
- authEmail: this email you will use it for two things:
  - you will use it as sender address.
  - you will use it to login to your smtp server.
- authPassword: the password of smtp server.

And all you have to do is call the function and pass the parameters you want.
